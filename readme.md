## Dependencies without the sting

Hoverfly is a light-weight open source tool for creating simulations of external services for use in development and testing. 
This technique is sometimes referred to as [service virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_virtualization).

Hoverfly was designed to provide you with the means to create your own "dependency sandbox": a simulated development and test environment that you control.
