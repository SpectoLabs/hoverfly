Hoverctl
========

Hoverctl is a command line utility that is shipped with Hoverfly. Its purpose is to make it easier to interact with Hoverfly APIs and your local filesystem, while also providing a way to start and stop instances of Hoverfly.

Hoverctl also has the ability to work with multiple instances of Hoverfly, through the use of the target option. Configuration is stored against each target meaning it is possible to start an instance of Hoverfly locally and remotely and still be able to interact with each separately.
