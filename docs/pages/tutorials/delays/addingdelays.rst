Adding delays to a simulation
=============================

Simulating API latency during development allows you to write code that will deal with it gracefully. 

In Hoverfly, delays are applied to responses by editing the Hoverfly simulation JSON file. Delays 
can be applied selectively according to request URL pattern and/or HTTP method.
