# Principles

## Minimize dependencies

The purpose of Hoverfly is to deal with the problem of external dependencies. Therefore, Hoverfly does not require any external dependencies to run. It is a single binary executable file.

## Run anywhere

Hoverfly is available as a pre-compiled binary for all major OSes, or in a Docker image. It is intended to be used on a developer's laptop, in a CI environment, or even in a production environment.

## Extend and integrate

Hoverfly can be extended using any programming language. It can store data locally, or import data from a remote URL or a local file path.

## Free and open source

Hoverfly is made available under the Apache Software License, version 2.
