## Dependencies without the sting

Hoverfly is a light-weight open source tool for creating simulations of external services for use in development and testing.
This technique is sometimes referred to as [service virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_virtualization).

Hoverfly was designed to provide you with the means to create your own "dependency sandbox": a simulated development and test environment that you control.

## Hoverfly + hoverctl

Hoverctl is a command line interface for Hoverfly. It uses the Hoverfly REST API to control local or remote Hoverfly instances and manage Hoverfly data.

## Quickstart

### Homebrew (OS X)

    brew install SpectoLabs/tap/hoverfly

### Installation script (Linux and OS X)

Run the install script to install Hoverfly and hoverctl:

    curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/master/install.sh && bash install.sh

### Binaries

Or [download the Hoverfly and hoverctl binaries](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/releases), set the correct permissions and copy them to a directory on your path.

Or get the docker image (Hoverfly only):

    docker pull spectolabs/hoverfly
    docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 8500:8500 spectolabs/hoverfly
