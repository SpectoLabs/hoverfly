## How to contribute to Faker

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jaswdr/faker/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one using our Bug report template](https://github.com/jaswdr/faker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+...). Be sure to include all requested information from the template.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new issue with the [Feature request template](https://github.com/jaswdr/faker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+...), include all requested information from the template, suggest your change and start writing code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Faker using the [Question template](https://github.com/jaswdr/faker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md&title=%5BQUESTION%5D+I+have+a+question%21).

Faker is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and enjoy!
