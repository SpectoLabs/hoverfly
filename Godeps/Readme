To update a single package:

`go get -u <package-name>`
`godep update <package-name>`

if there are multiple packages under the same root need to be updated, eg. github.com/SpectoLabs/goproxy and github.com/SpectoLabs/goproxy/ext/auth,
you need to update all at once using wildcard:

`godep update github.com/SpectoLabs/goproxy/...`
